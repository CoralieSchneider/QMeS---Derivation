    Description -> "We present the mathematica package QMeS. It derives symbolic flow equations from a master equation (FRG, mSTI, DSE) by using a superfield formalism. Explicitly it's modules allow to derive DSEs, take functional derivatives, trace over field space and do a momentum routing for 1-loop diagrams while keeping track of prefactors and signs that arise from fermionic commutation relations.",
